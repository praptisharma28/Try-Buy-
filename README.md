## Frontend

Frontend development refers to the process of creating the user interface and user experience of a website or web application. It involves designing and implementing the visual elements of a website that users interact with.

- **HTML (Hypertext Markup Language):** HTML is the standard markup language used to create the structure and content of web pages. It defines the elements that make up a web page, such as headings, paragraphs, links, images, forms, and more.

- **CSS (Cascading Style Sheets):** CSS is a crucial technology for web development used to style and format the visual presentation of HTML and XML documents.

- **JavaScript:** JavaScript is a widely-used programming language for building interactive and dynamic web applications. It allows you to create interactive and dynamic features on web pages, such as form validation, animations, and user interface enhancement.

## Web

### Bootstrap

Bootstrap is a popular open-source front-end framework for web development. It provides pre-designed, responsive, and customizable components for creating modern and mobile-friendly websites and web applications. Bootstrap uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for building responsive user interfaces.

### React for Better Performance

React is an open-source JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It allows developers to build reusable UI components and manage the state of an application efficiently. React is often used in conjunction with other technologies like JSX and libraries like React Router for handling routing.

## Backend

"Backend" typically refers to the server-side of a software application or website. It handles data storage, business logic, and client-side requests.

- **Programming Languages used:** Python is known for its simplicity and versatility and is commonly used in backend development.

- **Web Frameworks:**
  - Django (Python): A high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design.

- **Databases:** SQL databases (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, Microsoft SQL Server, and Oracle) are commonly used for structured data. SQL is essential for managing and querying data stored in relational databases.

## Authentication System (Google Cloud)

Google offers Firebase Authentication, a fully managed backend-as-a-service solution for user authentication in the Google Cloud environment. It supports email and password-based authentication, social logins, and more. Firebase Authentication is tightly integrated with other Google Cloud services and offers options for multi-factor authentication (MFA).

## Augmented Reality

Augmented Reality (AR) overlays digital information onto the real world, enhancing our perception of reality. Key components and characteristics of AR include:

- AR Devices: AR can be experienced through various devices, including smartphones, tablets, smart glasses, and headsets.

- Marker-based AR, Markerless AR, Object Recognition AR, Projection-based AR, and Head-up Displays (HUDs): Different AR technologies enhance the real world in various ways.

- Applications: AR is used in gaming, education, medical training, industrial maintenance, navigation, and more.

- Development Tools: Developers use AR development platforms and SDKs (Software Development Kits) to create AR apps and experiences.

- Spatial Mapping: AR systems may employ spatial mapping, allowing virtual objects to interact with physical space.

- Interaction Methods: Users interact with AR content through touch gestures, voice commands, or physical gestures tracked by the device's sensors.

## AR Tools

- **Unity:** Unity offers robust support for AR development through its AR Foundation framework. Developers can create AR applications and games with cross-platform support.

- **Blender:** Blender is a valuable tool for creating 3D content and assets for AR. It's commonly integrated with AR development frameworks like Unity with AR Foundation or ARCore/ARKit for mobile AR applications.
